    <h2>About&nbsp;me</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m a Telecom engineer and Linux SysAdmin who loves solving problems. Like the old hackers, I really need to understand how things work, so I like learning new things every day. I&#8217;m passionate about technology in general but specially about all internet related&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<h2>About this&nbsp;blog</h2>
<p>In 2005 I wanted to learn <span class="caps">PHP</span> so rather than using one of the popular blog engines available those days, I decided to write my own code to build my&nbsp;blog. </p>
<p>Since those early days I&#8217;ve been using this blog to write some blog entries about technical challenges I deal with&nbsp;everyday. </p>
<p>Nowadays I&#8217;ve replaced my beloved blog engine with a simple static site generator called <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a> with no database and no server-side logic requirements.
The new blog uses the beautifull theme <a href="https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage">Plumage</a> by Kevin Deldycke. On the other hand the blog content is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/frommelmak/blog">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>All the technical entries have been migrated into the new blog but if you want, you can still visit the old blog <a href="http://old.frommelmak.com">here</a>.</p>
